<p>I’d still like to write a tutorial going over an example where we use this build system for incremental batch builds, but at the same time also reuse the same build for an interactive environment.
This example will probably be something like interactively developing a parser with live feedback.</p>
<p>I’d also like to go over all kinds of extensions to the build system, as there are a lot of interesting ones.
Unfortunately, those will not be guided like the rest of this programming tutorial, due to lack of time.</p>
<h2 id="pie-implementations"><a class="header" href="#pie-implementations">PIE implementations</a></h2>
<p>In this tutorial, you implemented a large part of the PIE, the programmatic incremental build system that I developed during my PhD and Postdoc.
There are currently two versions of PIE:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Gohla/pie" title="" target="_blank">PIE in Rust</a>, a superset of what you have been developing in this tutorial. I plan to make this a full-fledged and usable library for incremental batch builds and interactive systems. You are of course free to continue developing the library you made in this tutorial, but I would appreciate users and/or contributions to the PIE library!</p>
<ul>
<li>The largest differences between PIE in this tutorial and the PIE library are:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Gohla/pie/blob/main/pie/src/lib.rs#L72" title="" target="_blank">Support for arbitrary task</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Gohla/pie/blob/main/pie/src/lib.rs#L74-L97" title="" target="_blank">resource types</a>, achieved by using <a href="https://github.com/Gohla/pie/blob/main/pie/src/trait_object/mod.rs" title="" target="_blank">trait objects</a> to provide dynamic dispatch. </li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Gohla/pie/blob/main/pie/src/lib.rs#L117-L130" title="" target="_blank">Resource abstraction</a> enables resources other than files. Resources are global mutable state where the state is not handled by the PIE library (as opposed to task inputs and outputs), but <em>read and write access to</em> that state <em>is</em> handled by PIE. <a href="https://github.com/Gohla/pie/blob/main/pie/src/resource/file.rs" title="" target="_blank">Files (as <code>PathBuf</code>)</a> are a resource, but so is a <a href="https://github.com/Gohla/pie/blob/main/pie/src/resource/map.rs" title="" target="_blank">hashmap</a>.</li>
<li>Terminology differences. The PIE library uses <em>read</em> and <em>write</em> for resource dependencies instead of <em>require</em> and <em>provide</em>. This allows us to use <em>require</em> only for tasks, and <em>read</em> and <em>write</em> only for resources. It uses <em>checkers</em> instead of <em>stampers</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The motivation for developing a PIE library in Rust was to test whether the idea of a programmatic incremental build system really is programming-language agnostic, as a target for developing this tutorial, and to get a higher-performance implementation compared to the Java implementation of PIE.</li>
<li>In my opinion, implementing PIE in Rust as part of this tutorial is a much nicer experience than implementing it in Java, due to the more powerful type system and great tooling provided by Cargo. However, supporting multiple task types, which we didn’t do in this tutorial, is a bit of a pain due to requiring trait objects, which can be really complicated to work with in certain cases. In Java, everything is a like a trait object, and you get many of these things for free, at the cost of garbage collection and performance of course.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/metaborg/pie" title="" target="_blank">PIE in Java</a>. The motivation for using Java was so that we could use PIE to correctly incrementalize the <a href="https://spoofax.dev/" title="" target="_blank">Spoofax Language Workbench</a>, a set of tools and interactive development environment (IDE) for developing programming languages. In Spoofax, you develop a programming language by <em>defining</em> the aspects of your language in <em>domain-specific meta-languages</em>, such as SDF3 for syntax definition, and Statix for type system and name binding definitions. </p>
<p>Applying PIE to Spoofax culminated in <a href="https://spoofax.dev/spoofax-pie/develop/" title="" target="_blank">Spoofax 3</a> (sometimes also called Spoofax-PIE), a new version of Spoofax that uses PIE for all tasks such as generating parsers, running parsers on files to create ASTs, running highlighters on those ASTs to provide syntax highlighting for code editors, etc. Because all tasks are PIE tasks, we can do correct and incremental batch builds of language definitions, but also live development of those language definitions in an IDE, using PIE to get feedback such as inline errors and syntax highlighting as fast as possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="publications-about-pie"><a class="header" href="#publications-about-pie">Publications about PIE</a></h2>
<p>We wrote two papers about programmatic incremental build systems and PIE, for which updated versions are in my dissertation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gkonat.github.io/assets/dissertation/konat_dissertation.pdf#page=105" title="" target="_blank">Chapter 7, page 83: PIE: A Domain-Specific Language for Interactive Software Development Pipelines</a>. </p>
<p>This describes a domain-specific language (DSL) for programmatic incremental build systems, and introduces the PIE library in Kotlin. This implementation was later changed to a pure Java library to reduce the number of dependencies. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gkonat.github.io/assets/dissertation/konat_dissertation.pdf#page=131" title="" target="_blank">Chapter 8, page 109: Scalable Incremental Building with Dynamic Task Dependencies</a>.</p>
<p>This describes a hybrid incremental build algorithm that builds from the bottom-up, only switching to top-down building when necessary. Bottom-up builds are more efficient with changes that have a small effect (i.e., most changes), due to only <em>checking the part of the dependency graph affected by changes</em>. Therefore, this algorithm <em>scales down to small changes while scaling up to large dependency graphs</em>. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, we did not implement (hybrid) bottom-up building in this tutorial due to a lack of time. However, the <a href="https://github.com/Gohla/pie" title="" target="_blank">PIE in Rust</a> library has a <a href="https://github.com/Gohla/pie/blob/master/pie/src/context/bottom_up.rs" title="" target="_blank">bottom-up context implementation</a> which you can check out. Due to similarities between the top-down and bottom-up context, some common functionality was <a href="https://github.com/Gohla/pie/blob/master/pie/src/context/mod.rs" title="" target="_blank">extracted into an extension trait</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We published a summary/abstract paper as well:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gkonat.github.io/assets/publication/pie-ic19.pdf" title="" target="_blank">Precise, Efficient, and Expressive Incremental Build Scripts with PIE</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two master students graduated on extensions to PIE:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A3bd052ee-b8a0-4687-85d0-ca6df0b07d0d" title="" target="_blank">Roelof Sol: Task Observability in Change Driven Incremental Build Systems with Dynamic Dependencies</a>. A problem with bottom-up builds is that tasks stay in the dependency graph forever, even if they are no longer needed. Even though those tasks are not executed (because they are not needed), they do need to be <em>checked</em> and increase the size of the dependency graph which in turn has overhead for several graph operations. To solve that problem, we introduce <em>task observability</em>.</p>
<p>A task is observable if and only if it is <em>explicitly observed</em> by the user of the build system through directly requiring (<code>Session::require</code>) the task, or if it is <em>implicitly observed</em> by a require task dependency from another task. Otherwise, the task is <em>unobserved</em>. The build system updates the observability status of tasks while the build is executing.</p>
<p>Unobserved tasks are <em>never checked</em>, removing the checking overhead. Unobserved tasks can be removed from the dependency graph in a “garbage collection” pass, removing graph operation overhead. Removing unobserved tasks is flexible: during the garbage collection pass you can decide to keep a task in the dependency graph if you think it will become observed again, to keep its cached output. You can also remove the provided (intermediate or output) files of an unobserved task to clean up disk space, which is correct due to the absence of hidden dependencies!</p>
<p>Currently, observability is implemented in the Java implementation of PIE, but not yet in the Rust implementation of PIE.</p>

<p><a href="https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A567a7faf-1460-4348-8344-4746a18fb0b1" title="" target="_blank">Ivo Wilms: Extending the DSL for PIE</a>. This improves and solves many problems in the original PIE DSL implementation. It introduces a module system, compatibility with dependency injection, and generics with subtyping into the DSL. Generics and subtyping have a proper type system implementation in the <a href="https://spoofax.dev/references/statix/" title="" target="_blank">Statix</a> meta-DSL.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One paper was published about using PIE:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://programming-journal.org/2020/4/16/" title="" target="_blank">Constructing Hybrid Incremental Compilers for Cross-Module Extensibility with an Internal Build System</a>. This paper introduces a compiler design approach for reusing parts of a non-incremental to build an incremental compiler, using PIE to perform the incrementalization. The approach is applied to <a href="https://spoofax.dev/references/stratego/" title="" target="_blank">Stratego</a>, a term transformation meta-DSL with several cross-cutting features that make incremental compilation hard. The result is the Stratego 2 compiler that is split up into multiple PIE tasks to do incremental parsing (per-file), incremental name analysis, and incremental compilation.

<h3 id="pluto"><a class="header" href="#pluto">Pluto</a></h3>
<p>PIE is based on <a href="https://www.pl.informatik.uni-mainz.de/files/2019/04/pluto-incremental-build.pdf" title="" target="_blank">Pluto</a>, a programmatic incremental build system developed by Sebastian Erdweg et al.
This is not a coincidence, as Sebastian Erdweg was my PhD promotor, and coauthored the “Scalable Incremental Building with Dynamic Task Dependencies” paper.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.pl.informatik.uni-mainz.de/files/2019/04/pluto-incremental-build.pdf" title="" target="_blank">Pluto paper</a> provides a more formal proof of incrementality and correctness for the top-down build algorithm, which provides confidence that this algorithm works correctly, but also explains the intricate details of the algorithm very well.
Note that Pluto uses “builder” instead of “task”.
In fact, a Pluto builder is more like an incremental function that <em>does not carry its input</em>, whereas a PIE task is more like an incremental closure that includes its input.</p>
<p>PIE uses almost the same top-down build algorithm as Pluto, but there are some technical changes that make PIE more convenient to use.
In Pluto, tasks are responsible for storing their output and dependencies, called “build units”, which are typically stored in files.
In PIE, the library handles this for you.
The downside is that PIE requires a mapping from a <code>Task</code> (using its <code>Eq</code> and <code>Hash</code> impls) to its dependencies and output (which is what the <code>Store</code> does), and some modifications had to be done to the consistency checking routines.
The upside is that tasks don’t have to manage these build unit files, and the central <code>Store</code> can efficiently manage the entire dependency graph.
Especially this central dependency graph management is useful for the bottom-up build algorithm, as we can use <a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~phjk/Publications/DynamicTopoSortAlg-JEA-07.pdf" title="" target="_blank">dynamic topological sort algorithms for directed acyclic graphs</a>.</p>
<h3 id="other-incremental-build-systems-with-dynamic-dependencies"><a class="header" href="#other-incremental-build-systems-with-dynamic-dependencies">Other incremental build systems with dynamic dependencies</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2018/03/build-systems.pdf" title="" target="_blank">Build Systems à la Carte</a> shows a systematic and executable framework (in Haskell) for developing and comparing build systems. It compares the impact of design decisions such as what persistent build information to store, the scheduler to use, static/dynamic dependencies, whether it is minimal, supports early cutoff, and whether it supports distributed (cloud) builds. 
Even though the Haskell code might be a bit confusing if you’re not used to functional programming, it is a great paper that discusses many aspects of programmatic incremental build systems and how to implement them.</p>
<h4 id="shake"><a class="header" href="#shake">Shake</a></h4>
<p><a href="https://shakebuild.com/" title="" target="_blank">Shake</a> is an incremental build system implemented in Haskell, described in detail in the <a href="https://ndmitchell.com/downloads/paper-shake_before_building-10_sep_2012.pdf" title="" target="_blank">Shake Before Building</a> paper.
The main difference in the model between Shake and PIE is that Shake follows a more target-based approach as seen in Make, where targets are build tasks that provide the files of the target.
Therefore, the output (provided) files of a build task need to be known up-front.
The upside of this approach is that build scripts are easier to read and write and easier to parallelize.
However, the main downside is that it is not possible to express build tasks where the names of provided files are only known after executing the task.
For example, compiling a Java class with inner classes results in a class file for every inner class with a name based on the outer and inner class, which is not known up-front.</p>
<p>Implementation wise, Shake can do parallel builds whereas PIE cannot (at the time of writing).
Parallel builds in PIE are tricky because two build tasks executing in parallel could require/provide (read/write) to the same file, which can result in data races.
Shake avoids this issue by requiring provided files to be specified as targets up-front, speeding up builds through parallelism.
In PIE, this might be solvable with a protocol where tasks first call a <code>Context</code> method to tell PIE about the files that will be provided, or the directory in which files will be provided, so PIE can limit parallelism on those files and directories.
Tasks that do not know this up-front cannot be executed in parallel, but can still be executed normally.</p>
<h4 id="rattle"><a class="header" href="#rattle">Rattle</a></h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ndmitchell/rattle" title="" target="_blank">Rattle</a> is a build system focussing on easily turning build scripts into incremental and parallel build scripts without requiring dependency annotations, described in detail in the <a href="https://ndmitchell.com/downloads/paper-build_scripts_with_perfect_dependencies-18_nov_2020.pdf" title="" target="_blank">Build Scripts with Perfect Dependencies</a> paper. 
To make this possible, Rattle has a very different model compared to PIE.</p>
<p>Rattle build scripts consist of (terminal/command-line) commands such as <code>gcc -c main.c</code>, and simple control logic/manipulation to work with the results of commands, such as if checks, for loops, or changing the file extension in a path.
Therefore, future commands can use values of previous commands, and use control logic to selectively or iteratively execute commands.
Commands create dynamic file dependencies, both reading (require) and writing (provide), which are automatically detected with dependency tracing on the OS level.
There are no explicit dependencies between commands, but implicit dependencies arise when a command reads a file that another command writes for example.</p>
<p>Rattle incrementally executes the commands of a build script, skipping commands for which no files have changed.
The control logic/manipulation around the commands is not incrementalized.
Rattle build scripts can be explicitly parallelized, but Rattle also implicitly parallelizes builds by speculatively executing future commands.
If speculation results in a hazard, such as a command reading a file and then a command writing to that file – equivalent to a hidden dependency in PIE – then the build is inconsistent and must be restarted without speculative parallelism.</p>
<p>The best way I can explain the core difference is that Rattle builds a <em>single build script</em> which is a <em>stream of commands</em> with <em>file dependencies</em>; whereas in PIE, every build task is in essence <em>its own build script</em> that <em>produces an output value</em>, with file dependencies but also <em>dependencies between build tasks</em>.
Both models have merit!</p>
<p>The primary advantage of the Rattle model is that existing build scripts, such as Make scripts or even just Bash scripts, can be easily converted to Rattle build scripts by converting the commands and control logic/manipulation into Rattle.
No file dependencies have to be specified since they are automatically detected with file dependency tracing.
Then, Rattle can parallelize and incrementally execute the build script.
Therefore, Rattle is great for incrementalizing and parallelizing existing Make/Bash/similar build scripts with very low effort.</p>
<p>While it is possible to incrementalize these kind of builds in PIE, the effort will be higher due to having to split commands into task, and having to report the file dependencies to PIE.
If PIE had access to reliable cross-platform automated file dependency tracing, we could reduce this effort by building a “command task” that executes arbitrary terminal/command-line commands.
However, reliable cross-platform file dependency tracking does not exist (to my knowledge, at the time of writing).
The library that Rattle uses, <a href="https://github.com/jacereda/fsatrace" title="" target="_blank">Fsatrace</a>, has limitations such as not detecting reads/writes to directories, and having to disable system integrity protection on macOS.
Therefore, Rattle also (as mentioned in the paper, frustratingly) inherits the limitations of this library.</p>
<p>Compared to Rattle, the primary advantages of programmatic incremental build systems (i.e., the PIE model) are: </p>
<ul>
<li>The entire build is incrementalized (using tasks as a boundary), not just commands.</li>
<li>PIE can <em>rebuild a subset of the build script</em>, instead of only the entire build script.</li>
<li>Tasks can return any value of the programming language, not just strings.</li>
<li>Tasks are modular, and can be shared using the mechanism of the programming language.</li>
</ul>
<p>These properties are a necessity for use in interactive environments, such as a code editors, IDEs, or other using-facing interactive applications.
Therefore, the PIE model is more suited towards incrementalization in interactive environment, but can still be used to do incremental batch builds.</p>
<p>TODO: discuss parallelism, self-tracking, and cloud builds.</p>
