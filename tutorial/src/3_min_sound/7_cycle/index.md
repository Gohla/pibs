# Prevent Cycles

```admonish warning title="Under construction"
This page is under construction.

In this section, we will fix the remaining correctness issue with cyclic tasks.

Didn't we already catch dependency graph cycles in the Incremental Top-Down Context section?
Yes, you remembered right!
However, there is a corner case that we didn't handle.
The issue is that we add a task dependency to the dependency graph only _after the task has finished executing_.
We do this because we need the output from executing the task to create the dependency.

But what would happen if we made a task that just requires itself?
Let's figure that out in this section, in which we will:

1) Add cyclic tasks to the testing tasks.
2) Create tests to showcase the cyclic task execution problem.
3) Prevent cycles by _reserving_ a task dependency before executing the task.
4) Improve and add additional tests.

## Add cyclic testing tasks

We don't have any testing tasks to easily construct different kinds of cycles yet, so we will add those first.

Modify `pie/tests/common/mod.rs`:
       
```diff2html linebyline
{{#include ../../gen/3_min_sound/7_cycle/a_task.rs.diff}}
```

We add the `RequireSelf` task which directly requires itself.
We also add the `RequireA` and `RequireB` tasks which require each other in a cycle.
We want to prevent both of these kinds of cycles.

## Add cycle tests 

Now add tests that check whether requiring these tasks (correctly) panics due to cycles.

Modify `pie/tests/top_down.rs`:

```rust,
{{#include b_test.rs:3:}}
```

These test are simple: require the task and that's it.
Which of these tests will correctly result in a cyclic task dependency panic?

```admonish warning title="Infinite Recursion"
Running these tests will result in infinite recursion, but should quickly cause a stack overflow.
However, be sure to save everything in the event your computer becomes unresponsive.
```

```admonish failure title="Expected Test Failure"
Tests `require_self_panics`, `require_cycle_a_panics`, and `require_cycle_b_panics` will fail as expected, which we will fix in this section!
```

Run the tests with `cargo test`, or skip running them (and comment them out) if you don't want to waste battery life running infinite recursions.
These tests will infinitely recurse and thus fail.

The issue is that we only add a dependency to the dependency graph _after the task has executed_.
We do this because we need the output from the executing task to create the dependency.
Therefore, no dependencies are ever added to the dependency graph in these tests, because a task never finishes executing!
This in turn causes the cycle detection to never trigger, because there is no cycle in the dependency graph.

To fix this, we need to add task dependencies to the dependency graph _before we execute the task_.
But we cannot do this, because we need the output of the task to create the task dependency.
Therefore, we need to first _reserve_ a task dependency in the dependency graph, which creates an edge in the dependency graph without any attached data.

## Reserving task dependencies

To support reserved task dependencies, we will first add a `ReservedRequireTask` variant to `Dependency`.
Modify `pie/src/dependency.rs`:

```diff2html linebyline
{{#include ../../gen/3_min_sound/7_cycle/c_1_dependency.rs.diff}}
```

The `ReservedRequireTask` variant has no data, as this variant needs to be creatable before we have the output of the task.

A reserved task dependency cannot be consistency checked, so we panic if this occurs, but this will never occur if our implementation is correct.
A reserved task dependency is added from the current executing task that is being made consistent, and we never check a task that is already consistent this session.
As long as the reserved task dependency is updated to a real `RequireTask` dependency within this session, we will never check a reserved task dependency.

```admonish note title="Properties of the Build System"
Again, it is great that we have defined these kind of properties/invariants of the build system, so we can informally reason about whether certain situations occur or not.
```

This change breaks the `WritingTracker`, which we will update in `pie/src/tracker/writing.rs`:

```diff2html linebyline
{{#include ../../gen/3_min_sound/7_cycle/c_2_writing_tracker.rs.diff}}
```

Since reserved task dependencies are never checked, we can just ignore them in the `check_dependency_end` method.

Now we update the `Store` with a method to reserve a task dependency, and a method to update a reserved task dependency to a real one.
Modify `pie/src/store.rs`:

```diff2html
{{#include ../../gen/3_min_sound/7_cycle/c_3_store.rs.diff}}
```

We rename `add_task_require_dependency` to `reserve_task_require_dependency`, change it to add `Dependency::ReservedRequireTask` as edge dependency data, and remove the `dependency` parameter since we don't need that anymore.
Note that this method still creates the dependency edge, and can still create cycles which need to be handled.
This is good, because this allows us to catch cycles before we start checking and potentially executing a task.
For example, this will catch the self-cycle created by `TestTask::RequireSelf` because `graph.add_edge` returns a cycle error on a self-cycle.

We add the `update_task_require_dependency` method to update a reserved task dependency to a real one.

As per usual, we will update the tests.
Modify `pie/src/store.rs`:

```diff2html
{{#include ../../gen/3_min_sound/7_cycle/c_4_store_test.rs.diff}}
```

We update `test_dependencies` to reserve and update task dependencies, and rename `test_add_task_require_dependency_panics`.
We add 2 tests for `update_task_require_dependency`.

The store now handles reserved task dependencies.
Now we need to use them in `TopDownContext`.
Task dependencies are made in `require_file_with_stamper`, so we just need to update that method.

Modify `pie/src/context/top_down.rs`:

```diff2html
{{#include ../../gen/3_min_sound/7_cycle/c_5_top_down.rs.diff}}
```

Before we call `make_task_consistent` and potentially execute a task, we first reserve the task dependency (if a task is currently executing).
Since `reserve_task_require_dependency` now can make cycles, we move the cycle check to the start.
As mentioned before, this will catch self cycles.

Additionally, this will add a dependency edge to the graph that is needed to catch future cycles, such as the cycle between `TestTask::RequireA` and `TestTask::RequireB`.
For example, `TestTask::RequireA` executes and requires `TestTask::RequireB`, thus we reserve an edge from A to B.
Then, we require and execute B, which requires A, thus we reserve an edge from B to A, and the cycle is detected!
If the edge from A to B was not in the graph before executing B, we would not catch this cycle.

After the call to `make_task_consistent` we have the consistent output of the task, and we update the reserved dependency to a real one with `update_task_require_dependency`.

This will correctly detect all cyclic tasks.
Confirm your changes work and all tests now succeed with `cargo test`.

```admonish success title="Fixed Tests"
Tests `require_self_panics`, `require_cycle_a_panics`, and `require_cycle_b_panics` should now succeed.
