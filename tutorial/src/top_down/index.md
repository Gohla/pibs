# Incremental Top-Down Context

In this chapter, we will implement an *incremental* build context.
An incremental context selectively executes tasks — only those that are affected by a change.
In other words, an incremental context executes the *minimum number of tasks* required to make all tasks up-to-date.

However, due to dynamic dependencies, this is not trivial.
We cannot first gather all tasks into a dependency tree and then topologically sort that, as dependencies are added and removed *while tasks are executing*.
To do incremental builds in the presence of dynamic dependencies, we need to check and execute affected tasks *one at a time*, updating the dependency graph, while tasks are executing.
To achieve this, we will employ a technique called *top-down incremental building*, which starts checking if a top (root) task needs to be executed, and recursively checks whether dependent tasks should be executed until we reach the bottom (leaf) task(s), akin to a depth-first search.

Build systems almost always interact with the file system in some way. 
For example, tasks read configuration and source files, or write intermediate and binary files.
Thus, a change in a file can affect a task that reads it, and executing a task can result in writing to new or existing files.
Therefore, we will also keep track of *file dependencies*.
Like task dependencies, file dependencies are also tracked dynamically while tasks are executing.

Before we start coding, let's sketch the outline of the solution — we will:

* Extend `Context` with a way to for tasks to register file dependencies.
  * Implement file system utility functions in module `fs`.
  * Make `NonIncrementalContext` compatible with the extension to `Context`.
* Implement an `IncrementalTopDownContext` that does incremental building.
  * Implement `Dependency` to represent dependencies.
  * Implement `Store` that keeps track of the dependency graph.
* Write tests for `IncrementalTopDownContext` to confirm that it is sound and incremental.
  * Implement a `Tracker` that can track build events, so we can assert whether a task has executed or not to test incrementality.

## Adding File Dependencies

To support file dependencies, add a method to the `Context` trait in `src/lib.rs`:

```rust,customdiff
{{#include ../../gen/top_down/0_lib_b.rs.diff:4:}}
```

`require_file` is similar to requiring a task, but instead takes a `path` to a file or directory on the filesystem as input.
We use `AsRef<Path>` as the type for the path, so that we can pass anything in that can dereference to a path.
For example, `str` has an `AsRef<Path>` implementation, so we can just use `"test.txt"` as a path.

As an output, we return `Result<Option<File>, io::Error>`, with `File` being a handle to an open file.
The reason for this complicated type is:

* An incremental context will want to read the metadata (such as the last modified date) of the file, or create a hash over the file, to be able to detect changes. Because getting metadata or reading the file can fail, and we want to propagate this error, we return a `Result` with `io::Error` as the error type.
* Tasks can create a dependency to a file that does not exist, and the existence of that file affects the task. For example, a task that prints true or false based on if a file exists. If the file does not exist (or it is a directory), we cannot open it, so we cannot return a `File`, hence we use `Option<File>` to return `None`.
* Otherwise, we return `Ok(Some(file))` so that the task can read the opened file.

[Recoverable error handling](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html) in Rust is done with the `Result<T, E>` type, which can either be `Ok(t)` or `Err(e)`.
In contrast to many languages which use exceptions, throwing, and exception handling; Rust treats recoverable errors just as regular values.

Similarly, [optional values](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/) in Rust are defined using the `Option<T>` type, which can either be `Some(t)` or `None`.

Rust has many traits for converting values or references into others, which provides a lot of convenience in what would otherwise require a lot of explicit conversions.
[`AsRef<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.AsRef.html) is such a conversion trait, that can convert itself into `&T`. 
Here, we use `AsRef<Path>` as a generic with a trait bound to support many different kinds of values to the `path` argument in `require_file`.
For example, we can call `context.require_file("test.txt")` because `str`, which is the type of string constants, [implements `AsRef<Path>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/std/path.rs.html#3136-3141).
You can also see this as a kind of method overloading, without having to provide concrete overloads for all supported types.
```

Now we need to implement this method for `NonIncrementalContext`.
However, because we will be performing similar file system operations in the incremental context as well, we will create some utility functions for this first.
Add module `fs`:

```rust,customdiff
{{#include ../../gen/top_down/0_lib_c.rs.diff:4:}}
```

Create file `src/fs.rs` with:

```rust,
{{#include 0_fs.rs}}
```

The comments explain the behaviour.
Make the non-incremental context compatible by changing `src/context/non_incremental.rs`:

```rust,customdiff
{{#include ../../gen/top_down/0_non_incremental_context.rs.diff:4:}}
```

Since the non-incremental context does not track anything, we simply try to open the file and return it.
This implements the description we made earlier:

* If opening the file results in an error, the `?` operator returns `Err(...)` immediately.
* If the file does not exist or is a directory, `open_if_file` returns `None` and `file` is `None`.
* Otherwise, `file` is `Some(file)`.

Confirm everything is still working with `cargo test`.

The `?` operator makes it easy to [propgate errors](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html#a-shortcut-for-propagating-errors-the--operator).
Because errors are just values in Rust, to propgate an error, you'd normally have to match each result and manually propagate the error.
The `r?` operator applied to a `Result` `r` does this for you, it basically desugars to something like `match r { Err(e) => return Err(e), _ => {} }`.

Comments with three forward slashes `///` are [documentation comments](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-02-publishing-to-crates-io.html#making-useful-documentation-comments) that document the function/struct/enum/trait/etc. they are applied to.
```

## Implementing the Incremental Context

Now we get to the fun part!
