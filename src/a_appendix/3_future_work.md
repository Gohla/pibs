# Future work

I'd still like to write a tutorial going over an example where we use this build system for incremental batch builds, but at the same time also reuse the same build for an interactive environment.
This example will probably be something like interactively developing a parser with live feedback.
 
I'd also like to go over all kinds of extensions to the build system, as there are a lot of interesting ones.
Unfortunately, those will not be guided like the rest of this programming tutorial, due to lack of time.
